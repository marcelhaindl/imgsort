# Contributing

We welcome both issue reports and pull requests! Please follow these guidelines to help maintainers respond effectively.

## Issues

- **Before opening a new issue:**
  - Use the search tool to check for existing issues or feature requests.
  - Review existing issues and provide feedback or react to them.
  - Use English for all communications — it is the language all maintainers read and write.
  - For bug reports involving sensitive security issues, email <marcel.haindl@gmail.com> instead of posting publicly.

- **Reporting a bug:**
  - Please provide a clear description of your issue, and a minimal reproducible code example if possible.
  - Include the Gin version (or commit reference), Go version, and operating system.
  - Indicate whether you can reproduce the bug and describe steps to do so.

- **Feature requests:**
  - Before opening a request, check that a similar idea hasn’t already been suggested.
  - Clearly describe your proposed feature and its benefits.
