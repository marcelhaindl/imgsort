# imgsort

**imgsort** is a command-line tool written in Go that helps organize your image files by sorting them into subfolders based on their date and time metadata. Simply point imgsort at a folder containing your images, and it will automatically move each image into a subfolder named after the date the photo was taken, making it easy to keep your photo collection organized and accessible.
